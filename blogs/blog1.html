                        <p style="text-indent: 25px; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Insomnia – a word that typically feels disconnected from the energetic world of teenagers – has been my constant companion since the day I stepped into school back in fifth grade. They say that an average human needs a solid 8 hours of sleep each night. But for me, achieving this goal feels like trying to navigate a maze in the dark with only a dimly lit candle.</p>

                        <p style="text-indent: 25px; font-family: Georgia, serif;">You might be wondering, "Why not just go to bed earlier?" Ah, my friends, if only it were that simple. It turns out that the universe has a way of making the most mundane tasks fascinating at precisely 11:30 PM. Picture this: while everyone in my dorm is fast asleep, and even snoring, I'm wide awake, staring at the ceiling. I start to think about life's big questions. Why can't I fall asleep? What is the meaning of life? Why does pizza taste so good? It's like my brain becomes a philosopher on caffeine.</p>

                        <p style="text-indent: 25px; font-family: Georgia, serif;">This journey has been nothing short of an adventure. I've explored every avenue, from the classic remedy of counting sheep to the tranquil practice of meditation before bedtime. I've even resorted to hours of playing basketball in the hopes of completely wearing myself out. But, sadly, none of these tricks have helped me sleep better.</p>

                        <p style="text-indent: 25px; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Now, let's address the elephant in the room – school the next day. The sleep deprivation turns the classroom into a stand-up comedy club where my yawns are the punchlines. Have you ever tried to take a nap during History class and wake up convinced you just missed the most critical moment of the French Revolution? It's like time travel, but without the cool effects.</p>

                        <p style="text-indent: 25px; font-family: Georgia, serif;">But, as the years rolled on, I began to have a revelation. I figured I might just have a secret mutant gene or something. Forget Professor X and Magneto; I'm the Sleep-X, the mutant who thrives on fewer hours of sleep, like Nikola Tesla who was still six feet two. Instead of losing sleep over my sleep deprivation, I decided to embrace it, live with it, and, lo and behold, I started sleeping better. Who knew my path to better sleep involved not worrying about it at all!</p>

                        <p style="text-indent: 25px; font-family: Georgia, serif;">In the end, what I've learned from my journey is that sometimes, we can find unexpected solutions when we stop obsessing over the problem. Through embracing our unique qualities, even the ones that seem like challenges, can lead to surprising improvements in our lives. So, just like my mission impossible to better sleep, I encourage all of you to find your own path to solutions, and who knows, you might discover that the answers were there all along, waiting for you to let go of the worries and embrace the possibilities.</p>
