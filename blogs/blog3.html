                            <p>"The only thing that interferes with my learning is my education." - Albert Einstein</p>

                        <p>Alarm, backpack, PowerPoint, homework, eat, sleep, repeat - occasionally punctuated by a test or two. Why can't I just immerse myself in piano music and spend a leisurely afternoon reading? This thought surfaces daily after I finish lunch. Sometimes, even weekends fail to diminish the dark circles under my eyes - the state I’m in right now, typing these words with unconscious fingers; a bodiless soul pondering about the meaning of education with a soulless body. Nevertheless, the purpose of this blog isn't to complain about my school life. Instead, I aim to present some reflections on the conventional education system, a topic that has sparked debate in every country and across generations.</p>

                        <p>Nevertheless, the purpose of this blog isn't to boast about my younger self. Instead, I aim to present some reflections on the conventional education system, a topic that has sparked debate in every country and across generations.</p>

                        <p>Einstein once said, “The only thing that interferes with my learning is my education.” This statement doesn’t straightforwardly suggest that education limits or conflicts with learning. Although there are concerns that the widespread use of nationalistic textbooks in some areas not only gives rise to a "Big Brother is Watching" sentiment but also stifles spontaneous thought and independent action, the ever-increasing access to the internet has nearly nullified this effect. What Einstein meant by this quote is that the conventional system of education hinders innovation. In this context, 'education' isn't merely about teaching; it encompasses popular perceptions and understandings held by the masses, which cannot be yardsticks that ascertain the truth.</p>

                        <p>Before the Common Era, Greek philosopher Aristotle proposed the geocentric theory, which was widely accepted for thousands of years until Copernicus presented his heliocentric model, asserting that the sun, not the Earth, is the center of the universe. Surprisingly (and unsurprisingly), the majority condemned Copernicus, calling for his punishment and thus ironically highlighting the constraints of traditional beliefs at the time.</p>
                        
                        <p>We see a pattern: education sometimes perpetuates established beliefs rather than fostering new ideas. It hinders learning and innovation because it confuses the predominant crowd into believing everything they heard through the mouths of others. It does not interfere with Einstein’s learning, but instead propagates people who can’t say lucid between common perceptions. That’s why if you magnify all the grand discoveries of our great ancestors, nearly none were confined in the walls of textbooks. If the great pragmatist Benjamin Franklin chose to attend into Harvard University (of course, that was then) and sought rich titles instead of pursuing his experiments; it's likely that someone else would grace the hundred-dollar bill. Similarly, if Steve Jobs strictly followed all his school teachings and never performed pranks on people, he might have not become friends with Wozniak under Professor McCollum’s course, and thus the blue box will never be invented. In other words, Apple will never be founded.</p>
                        
                        <p>But does simply by inferring that great people break through the bonds of schools and colleges mean that education is an unnecessary step? Quite the contrary. We live on a small planet with a vast population. Recall that two of the motivations for the Sunday School Movement, a frontier in promoting education in Europe, are to establish public order and promote economic growth. That was just back then, nearly two centuries ago, where people already realized the importance of educating the population. Education is essential, not only for stabilizing society but also for enhancing collective knowledge. Who would have appreciated Einstein's breakthrough in relativity theory if only a few understood the law of gravity? Thus, when Einstein said, “The only thing that interferes with my learning is education,” he was referring to innovation, not the comprehension of the general public. And it turns out that, unless for purely pragmatic people, all the new theories claimed proved out to be based on existing knowledge. As Newton put it, “If I have seen further than others, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants.” Innovation roots from the remarkable asymmetry between the ways people’s mind treats things they were informed upon.</p>
                        
                        <p>Reflecting on my younger self, I would pose the question: "Is education necessary?” I'm not inclined to lecture him about the empathetic values of education in providing opportunities to those in need. Even as a youth, I grasped this concept to some extent when I chose to enter the education system and college pathway in the United States. Instead, if one can already self learn all the things on the internet, the fundamental purpose of education then turns back into its rudimentary state - to provide oppotunities. The word “opportunity” comes in multiple meanings. It can signify promoting equality or opening up new future pathways. The transformative and rational experiences offered by universities could change your life forever, and the choice of path is yours to make.</p>
                        
                        <p>Thus, to this day, education extends beyond merely interfering with one's learning; it imparts knowledge built upon the shoulders of giants, sustains the functioning of our world in the present, and opens up opportunities for the future. In essence, "education" is really an umbrella term encompassing three distinct periods: the past, the present, and the future.</p>
